												<p> Launched an Android (Java) and Web Application (Javascript, HTML, CSS) by implementing Esri's ArcGIS SDK.

											<div class="content">
												<p> Using Unity and the Vuforia Engine, I developed an augmented reality game. The goal of the game is to score as many baskets as you can within a certain time limit.
													How the game works: once the user has a specific image in the camera's view, a basketball hoop and backboard will appear and the user will be able to shoot the ball in.
													As the player scores, they are able to keep track of how many shots are made.

													Git was used to coordinate version control of the source code.</p>
