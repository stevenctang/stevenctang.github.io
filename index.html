											<div class="content">
												<p>In this class we were put into groups to simulate a software engineering company. My group was assigned to work on a project that used API's from Esri. The iOS application name is RoomQuest. We developed an iOS application from scratch which was targeted towards visitors and students of CSUSB. Our application was able to search for a class room on campus, look for the user's current location, and show locations of various places such as the ATM or Health Center. If we were to have more time, we would have worked on routing next.</p>

											<h2>Unit Augmeneted Reality Game</h2>

											</span>
											<div class="content">
												<p>For my indepedent study course I wanted to work with augmented reality to try to create games such as Pokemon GO. I worked with 2 other students to develop a number of applications that dealt with augmented reality. To develop mobile games that dealt with augmented reality, we used Unity. Along with Unity we used a plugin called Vuforia to make it work. The application that we worked on the most throughout the quarter was a basketball game. Once the user has a specific image in the camera's view, a hoop will appear where the user will be able to shoot the ball in. The user is able to keep track of how many shots they have made.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<p>The Discord Bot was created in Java using Discord's SDK. This is a simple bot that is interactive as long as you choose one of the commands it has. The bot can provide a live weather forecast for a location the user specifies by utilizing an API from OpenWeatherMap. The bot is also able to stream music from Youtube/Twitch, display player stats for the FPS game Rainbow Six Siege, and more. </p>

											</span>
											<div class="content">
												<p> Developed an iOS Application that would provide information to the costumer by utilizing numerous API's. 
													The application utilizes Google's Map SDK as well as their cloud-based NoSQL database to extract/store live data.
													OAuth2.0 was implemented to provide authentication and authorization for REST services.
													Git was used to coordinate version control of the source code.</p>
